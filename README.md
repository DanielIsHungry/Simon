# Simon
A tkinter application that is similar to the 90's game simon. It revolves around having four buttons, with a pattern you need to memorize.
If you press correctly, the screen flashes green, however if you press incorrectly, it flashes red and you'll start all over again.

## Features
- Rage quitting guaranteed
